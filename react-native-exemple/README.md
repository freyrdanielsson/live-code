# React Native exemple

To launch the project

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

It will open a tab in your browser under `localhost:19002` by default. This is the debugging console. Press the button `Run on iOS simulator` to open an iphone and be able to launch the exemple. Check out the [step by step](STEP_BY_STEP.md) file to see how I did the overlay from scratch.
